## PYCARET-Low-Code-Tasks


PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that streamlines machine learning workflows. It serves as an end-to-end tool for machine learning and model management, significantly enhancing productivity by accelerating the experimental cycle.

Low-Code Efficiency
Unlike traditional machine learning libraries, PyCaret allows users to replace extensive code with just a few lines. This low-code approach leads to faster and more efficient experimentation, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

Integration with Popular Libraries
PyCaret acts as a wrapper around several well-known machine learning libraries and frameworks, including scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, and Ray. This integration enables users to leverage multiple tools seamlessly.

Typical Workflow
A typical PyCaret workflow consists of five key steps:

Setup: Preparing the data and environment.
Compare Models: Evaluating different machine learning models.
Analyze Model: Assessing model performance.
Prediction: Making predictions using the selected model.
Save Model: Storing the model for future use.
